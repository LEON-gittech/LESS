Five more computers were installed each day, from monday to thursday. How many computers are now in the server room?\nAnswer: There were originally 9 computers. For each of 4 days, 5 more computers were added. So 5 * 4 = 20 computers were added. 9 + 20 is 29. So the answer is 29.\n\nQuestion: Michael had 58 golf balls. On tuesday, he lost 23 golf balls. On wednesday, he lost 2 more. How many golf balls did he have at the end of wednesday?\nAnswer: Michael started with 58 golf balls. After losing 23 on tuesday, he had 58 - 23 = 35.
